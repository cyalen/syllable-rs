# readability-rs
A repo for Data Scientists/ML Engineers looking for classical readability metrics/NLP utils implemented natively in Rust.

This is currently a work-in-progress repo. If you find it useful and would like to contribute, feel free to submit a PR. If you have any feature requests/spot a bug, leave me an issue and I'll try and tackle it when I can.

If you're a more experienced Rust dev and you spy any inefficiencies, I'd be grateful for your feedback. I'm a relatively new Rustacean :crab: who works full-time as a Python-native ML Engineer, and therefore I might do dumb things sometimes.
